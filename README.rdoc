== Snail Manager

This is a personal project for managing mass correspondence, such as wedding invitations, holiday letters, etc.

Some interesting bits you might want to look at in the code:

* Polymorphic associations for domestic/international addresses.

* Person model, which maintains a historical record of addresses

* CSS for label printing app/assets/stylesheets/Avery8163.css
